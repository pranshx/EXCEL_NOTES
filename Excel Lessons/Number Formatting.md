# Number Formatting



##### sequence of number format (how you want \_ value to be shown)

+ve; -ve; zero value; text value



##### 0 \& # (Place Holder for the numbers)



\# > Variable place holder

0 > Fixed place holder



##### Rules 



1\. Comma (,) acts as a thousands separator when placed between digits (e.g., #,##0)

2\. Paced at the end of the format (e.g., #,##0,) act as a scaling factor dividing the number by 1,000 for each comma
